## Why I did it

Online Scout Manager is a website which allows people running scout troops to have less admin by handling payments, etc..

I absolutely hate the design of Online Scout Manager just look at the login page:

So I decided to make an app, I asked them for an API key which I realized was only for leaders and not for parent accounts so I had to mess around with parsing HTML pages.
